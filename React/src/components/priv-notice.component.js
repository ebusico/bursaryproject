    <p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading 'Cookies', below.</p>
    <p><span>Information that we obtain from third party sources</span></p>
    <p>We may receive personal information about you from third party sources (such as your employer if they enroll you on a course, or agencies if you apply for study or employment, but only where we believe that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us. We collect only the minimum amount of information required from these third parties to enable us to provide the requested service or process any application you send to us (for example, your educational or employment history). We only use the information we receive from these third parties as set out in this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Your Information</strong></p>
    <p>The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable us to provide our Services to you. In addition, we may use the information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to provide you with information or Services you request from us;</li>
        <li>to provide information on other QA products and Services which we feel may be of interest to you, in accordance with your communications and consent preferences;</li>

    <p>In general, we will use any of the information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect such information. However, we may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you do not want us to use your data for any marketing purposes, you will have the opportunity to withhold your consent to this when you provide your details to us.</p>
    <p>Consent can be varied online via the Website or cp.qa.com.</p>
    <p><strong>Storing and Retaining Your Personal Data</strong></p>
    <p>The personal information you provided to us is stored within secure servers. We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.</p>
    <p>All QA email addresses support TLS email encryption, so it is advised that if you are concerned about the contents of any email to use this encryption.</p>
    <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of our sites and portals, you are responsible for keeping these passwords confidential.</p>
    <p>Please note that the transmission of information via the internet (including email) is not completely secure and therefore, although we endeavor to protect the personal information you provide to us, we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically and the transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business or statutory need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclosing Your Information</strong></p>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information, with your consent, to any company within our corporate group. This includes, where applicable, our subsidiaries, our holding company and its subsidiaries.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose your personal information with:</p>

        <li>any other person with your consent to the disclosure. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where you are a customer or prospective customer, we may disclose your data to third parties for our marketing purposes so that we can identify products and services we think you will be interested in. Personal data used in this way may include contact details such as name, address, phone number, and email address. When sharing with third party marketing organisations, your data may be processed in countries inside or outside of the EU.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Links</strong></p>
    <p>You might find links to third party websites on our Websites or within documentation we provide.</p>

    <p><strong>Legal Basis (EEA visitors only).</strong></p>
    <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information being collected and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
    <p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for example, to enroll you into a course or provide you with learning materials);</li>
        <li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights; or</li>
        <li>where we have your consent to do so;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>
    <p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
    <p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
